# Buckets

Simple portfolio based on an CSV input file produced from Fidelity.

It expects a Portfolio Plan file that lists bucket sizes as a percentage of the over-all portfolio.
For now, there are 3 buckets, that must total 100% (at least 'should' total). The other rows in
the file are one per investment, with a ticker symbol, description, and three bucket allocation percentages.
